## Problem 1
- Scenario: Documents
- Assumptions:
  - I assume that the documents could all potentially be stored in a digital form in some way or another, and also that they could be printed out or stored in physical form. I'm going to assume that it's okay for the document system to not be able to be accessible from the internet.
- Assets:
  - The obvious assets that should be protected are the documents themselves and potentially metadata about them. More specifically, the confidentiality of the documents should be protected, meaning only letting people who are allowed to access them do so. Also, the integrity of the documents should be protected as well, meaning that the documents should not be able to be modified unless the person has permission to do so. The existence of the documents should also be protected, meaning not losing the documents to any system failures, but also making sure that documents that should be deleted are deleted and unrecoverable. Finally, the accessibility of the documents should be protected, meaning the ability to access the documents at any time.
- Threats:
  - The assets that I listed above correspond with the types of threats that I see too. I would choose to defend against attacks on the confidentiality of the documents, such as if some attacker tried to gain access to reading documents they shouldn't be allowed to be reading. This could include preventing people from pretending to be someone else to try and gain access to documents or the system. I would also choose to defend against attacks on the integrity of the documents too, such as if some attacker tried to modify the contents of a document in the system or even tried to add another document to the system. Also, I would choose to protect against attacks on the availability of the documents, such as if someone tried to perform a denial of service attack on the document system to prevent access of the documents, as well as accidental denial of service events such as fires.
- Countermeasures:
  - One countermeasure for both the confidentiality and integrity of the document system could be implementing a secure authentication and access control system as part of the document system to properly authenticate users to make sure they can prove with great certainty that they are who they say they are and also that they are allowed to access or modify the documents that they are trying to. Defending these things is probably the most important aspect of the document system, so deploying countermeasures like this one is a necessity and any costs associated with it are very likely justified in the eyes of the law firm to ensure these confidentiality and integrity aspects. One such authentication system could be requiring a retinal scan of the person wanting to access the documents. The benefits of this would be a high degree of confidence that the person is who they say they are, while the cost would be the cost of the scanners and the infrastructure needed to interface them with the document system. Another countermeasure could be only having the document system be on an internal network not accessible from the internet, so that people wanting to access the documents would have to go to the physical office of the law firm in order to do so. The cost of this countermeasure would potentially be the inconvenience that some users might encounter if they were working remotely and needed to read a document, but the benefits would be great since having it not accessible from the internet would cut off a significant amount of attack vectors and would require an attacker to physically be on site to launch an attack.
  - One countermeasure for attacks on the availability of the documents are to have both digital and physical copies of the documents in multiple locations, all with restricted access, such that it would greatly increase the cost for an attacker to try and launch a denial of service attack that would affect every single one of the ways of accessing the documents. The benefits would clearly be the availability of the documents while the costs of this would be the cost of renting or buying land, the building, guards, paper, security cameras, and other ways of identifying people who want to access the documents. In addition, having the documents in multiple places would help against accidents like fires or other disasters.

## Problem 2
- Scenario: Stadium
- Assumptions:
  - Since the football team is highly ranked, I will assume that the games have high attendance.
- Assets:
  - Some important assets include the safety and well-being of the players on the teams, the coaches, and everyone in the stadium. Another asset is the monetary profit that the games provide. This is likely very important to whoever is running the stadium. This also goes along with overall attendance of games as in the number of people present in the stands.
- Threats:
  - One threat that I would protect against is the possibility of someone bringing in a weapon or something that could cause harm to others in the stadium. For example, someone could bring a firearm or bomb into the stadium when there are many people. This threat would have a very bad effect such as people dying, but is somewhat unlikely on its own but could be lowered if countermeasures are put in place. Another threat that I would protect against is ticket scalpers, which could hurt attendance and profits because they might buy all of the tickets available for a game and then sell them at much higher levels, preventing more people from attending than could have normally. This would hurt attendance and profits in the long run because most of the money at games is made through concessions and merchandise rather than just ticket sales, so having lower attendance would affect those greatly. In addition, since the football team is highly ranked, it is likely that scalpers are a real problem since there is probably high demand for the tickets and seats.
- Countermeasures:
  - One countermeasure that I would take to try and prevent people from bringing in weapons is to require everyone attending the games to subject their bags to quick searches for weapons. The costs associated with this countermeasure would be the staff needed to do the searching and potentially some increased annoyance from the fans attending. The benefits would be having a basic level of confidence that no one brought any weapons into the game, as well as the fans feeling safer too.
  - One countermeasure that I would take to try and prevent ticket scalpers is setting a limit on the number of tickets that one person, business, or entity can purchase for one game. For example, if I set the limit to be 20 tickets, that is a fairly large reasonable limit for one person to buy, and it is incredibly likely that almost all the fans attending will never reach this limit when trying to buy tickets. Since it would affect so few people, the cost of doing this would only be the small loss in ticket sales of people who wanted to buy over 20 tickets for the same game. However, the benefits of making it harder for ticket scalpers to buy many tickets would be a greater likelyhood that normal fans would be the ones buying tickets directly, and those ticket sales to real fans are more likely to be attended than ticket sales to scalpers.

## Problem 3
- Scenario: You are a person who has a personal bank account which you want to keep safe. You use online banking to pay bills and check your account balance.
- Assumptions:
  - I assume that I can't control any of the security details on my bank's side, so I will only be focusing on what I can do to ensure the security of my accounts.
- Assets:
  - The most important asset is the account balance in the bank account. More specifically, I should be the only person who is allowed or able to withdraw money from the account. Even though I probably wouldn't mind getting extra money deposited into my account too, I should also probably be the only one who can deposit money in my account too. Another asset is my identity, or my ability to prove to the bank that I am who I say I am, to be able to access my bank account. No one else should be able to prove that they are me.
  - Another asset is me being able to be certain that I am talking to my bank and not to an attacker. I want to be able to be confident that when I am entering my password, I am only giving it to my bank and not to anyone else who might be listening in or even pretending to be the bank.
- Threats:
  - One threat is someone finding or guessing my password to my online bank account. Similarly, another threat is someone guessing the answers to my security questions which would give them the ability to bypass my password. Also, another threat is someone being able to forge my signature or get ahold of my drivers license or other means of identity proof to be able to impersonate me at a physical bank location. This is much more unlikely than all the others since it would require the attacker physically steal something from me, then get a mask to look like me, and other various things.
  - Another threat is someone pretending to be the bank and tricking me into giving them my credentials. This could be done with a phishing email or if I am using a compromised computer to login.
- Countermeasures:
  - One countermeasure that I can take against attackers gaining access to my bank account online is to make sure I use a strong password that is completely random, which I never write down or store anywhere except my head. The benefit of this is that there is nothing that attackers can do to gain more knowledge about what my password is other than asking me or making me tell them the password, or them brute forcing it. However, the cost of this could be quite high as it would involve me having to spend quite a bit of time memorizing this potentially long random string of characters.
  - Another countermeasure to ensure that I am the only person who can access my account is to use two factor authentication if my bank allowed it to not only rely on authenticating on something I know, the password, but also something that I have, my phone or some sort of two factor device. The benefit of this is that it would make it quite a bit harder for an attacker to gain access to my account as they would also have to physically get my phone or somehow circumvent the two factor step. The cost of this is a slightly longer time to login to the site as well as a bit more hassle if I were to lose my phone or something were to happen to it.
  - Another countermeasure that I could take is to ensure that I don't use any security question that is able to be answered by anyone other than myself. Some bad one are anything with maiden names, or the street I grew up on, etc, because all of those can potentially be looked up by an attacker, which they can then completely bypass my secure password. The cost of this would be that I potentially wouldn't be able to recover my password online if I forgot both my password and my answer to the security questions. The benefits would be that an attacker wouldn't be able to look up the answers to the security questions since they are only known in my mind.
  - A countermeasure for phishing emails is that I always check who the email is from and that the message was properly authenticated with DKIM, etc. Also, I can make sure I never click on any links in the email to get to the bank site, but always type in the bank site manually, to prevent being linked to a website that looks exactly like the bank site but is not. The benefit of this is better confidence that I am talking with my bank and not an attacker. The cost of this is just a slight inconvenience of having to type in the bank site address instead of clicking on a link in an email.
